                <li>1/4 cup pickle brine </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons Louisiana-style hot sauce</li>

                <h3>Sauce</h3>
                <li>1/4 cup butter </li>
                <li>1/4 cup lard </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons cayenne pepper </li>
                <li>1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika </li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder </li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt </li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
                <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Toss chicken pieces with 1 tablespoon kosher salt. Transfer chicken to a bowl; cover and refrigerate overnight.</li>
                <li>Whisk buttermilk, pickle brine, hot sauce, and egg together in a mixing bowl. Pour marinade over chicken and 
                    stir to ensure each piece is thoroughly coated. Cover and let chicken marinate in refrigerator 2 to 4 hours.</li>
                <li>Mix flour and salt together in a shallow flat dish. Remove chicken from marinade and blot with paper towels. Reserve 
                    marinade. Toss chicken in flour until thoroughly coated. Return chicken to marinade, coating all sides; remove chicken 
                    from marinade allowing excess to drip back into the bowl. Coat the chicken once again in flour mixture. Place on a rack. 
                    Repeat with all chicken pieces. Allow to sit out about 15 minutes to allow coating to dry out a bit.</li>
                <li>Place butter and lard in a large pot. Add cayenne pepper, brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, kosher salt, and black pepper. 
                    Place over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until fats melt. Remove from heat; keep sauce warm.</li>
                <li>Fill cast iron skillet about 1/3 of the way with vegetable oil. Heat oil to 350 degrees F over medium-high heat. Carefully 
                    place chicken into hot oil, skin side down. Maintain an oil temperature of 325 degrees F, adjusting heat as need. Fry until 
                    instant read thermometer reads 160 degrees F, 8 to 10 minutes per side.</li>
                <li>Transfer chicken to a rack to drain. Brush with the sauce on both sides.</li>
                <li>Serve chicken pieces on white bread and brush with the sauce. Serve with pickles.</li>
